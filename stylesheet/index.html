        <p>I feel privileged to be a citizen of this country. Our heritage is unique and our cultures. Now, the weather? Oh, Perfect!
            We have lovely weather all year, with a couple of surprises in between. I'm referring to the recent heavy snow,
             which is supposed to be hot in a semi-tropical province. Nevertheless, you can visit the likes of Nelson Mandela and
              Desmond Tutu Museum. Talk about two unique Noble Peace Prizes  who lived on the same street(vilakazi). Where can you find that? No, where!
              We have eleven official languages, and our diversity makes us a "Rainbow Nation" So, if you want to have a unique touring experience, come to Mzasi for sure!</p>
