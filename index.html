        <p>Hello,I'm from South Africa, Johannesburg in Gauteng Province. I live north of Gauteng, in a rural area and I
            love farming. I just moved here in February with my family, we came from Dube Soweto. We were looking for a
            quiter place because our home was on the main road. So, there is no peace at all, day or night. And so we
            thought it was a good idea for us to where is quite and peaceful. We love it here and we are looking to buy
            a smallholding for our son to run free or be chased by a rooster </p>

        <p>I feel privileged to be a citizen of this country. Our heritage is unique and our cultures. Now, the
            weather? Oh, Perfect!
            We have lovely weather all year, with a couple of surprises in between. I'm referring to the recent
            heavy snow,
            which is supposed to be hot in a semi-tropical province. Nevertheless, you can visit the likes of Nelson
            Mandela and
            Desmond Tutu Museum. Talk about two unique Noble Peace Prizes who lived on the same street(vilakazi).
            Where can you find that? No, where!
            We have eleven official languages, and our diversity makes us a "Rainbow Nation" So, if you want to have
            a unique touring experience, come to Mzasi for sure!</p>
